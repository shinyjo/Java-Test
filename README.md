# Java-Test
1. Local Variable is nothing but declared within the method and that variable can be used only in that particular method. Instance variables are declared in a class, but outside a method.
2. Yes.
3. Final is a keyword. If we do not want a class or method or anything that should not be over written or change the coding, Final is used.
4. A class that is declared with abstract keyword, is known as abstract class in java.
5. Interface support multiple inheritance and class will not support Multiple Inheritance.
6. A Method which used abstract key work is called abstract, it is used to declare and not to define.
7. Private is that we can use within the particular class. Public is that we can use anywhere in the programm. If we want to use any variable only within the package, protected can be used.
8. Method overloading is using same method name with different number of arguments or parameters. Method overriding is using same method name with same number of arguments in both parent and child class.
9. This() is used to refer the current class object. Super() is used to immediately refer the parent class object.
10. Checked Exception is nothing but all Exceptions checked in Compile Time. Unchecked Exception is all Exception checked in Run time.
11
12. 40 and 30.
13. Error will appear, because Final is used so we cannot change it.
14. Error will come.
Five marks:
"2. interface A
{
void print();
}
class B implements A
{
public void print() {System.out.println(""Hello"");
}
public static void main(String args[]) 
{
B obj = new B();
obj.print();
}
}"

"3. class Bike
{
void run() {System.out.println(""Fast"");
}
}
class Splender extends Bike
{
void run(){ System.out.println(""Running"");
}
public static void main(String args[]){
Bike b = new Scooty(); 
b.run();
}
}"
